Project Traceability System through Blockchain Technology for the Milk Production Chain, by Andr√© Cardoso de Carvalho. 


This work expose a traceability system for the milk production chain using blockchain technology and the ideals of industry 4.0. To this end, a proof of concept was created with the python programming language in the python3 version, as well as the Flask framework and the Javascript and HTML programming languages. The results obtained were quite satisfactory since they met expectations and managed to reach the proposed objective, since the chain data was emulated.
This work represents the final undergraduate project in Control and Automation Engineering at UFRJ and the more detailed description can be found in the PDF available.
